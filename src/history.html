        <h1 class="display-4">What is the Book of Proverbs?</h1>
        <p class="lead">The Book of Proverbs is one of the books of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament.
          It's a collection
          of
          wisdom sayings and teachings attributed primarily to King Solomon, who was known for his wisdom in ancient
          Israel.
          However, the book itself likely took shape over a long period, and scholars believe it was compiled by
          multiple
          authors over several centuries.</p>
    
    </div>
    <h1>Authorship</h1>
    <p>Traditionally, King Solomon, the son of King David, is credited with the authorship of many of the proverbs found
      in the book. The Bible itself states this in Proverbs 1:1: "The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel."
      Solomon was renowned for his wisdom, and many of the proverbs are attributed to him in the first part of the book.

      However, the book also includes proverbs from other authors, such as "The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh" (Proverbs
      30:1) and "The sayings of King Lemuelâ€”an inspired utterance his mother taught him" (Proverbs 31:1). These diverse
      attributions suggest that the book was likely compiled and edited over time, incorporating wisdom from various
      sources.</p>
    <h1>Composition and Date</h1>
    <p>The Book of Proverbs is a collection of wisdom literature, reflecting the traditional wisdom of ancient Israelite
      sages. It contains practical advice on many aspects of life, such as relationships, work, wealth, and morality.
      The
      proverbs are often short, pithy statements that convey general truths about the world.

      The book was likely compiled over several centuries, with some of the material possibly dating back to the time of
      Solomon in the 10th century BCE. However, the final form of the book probably took shape during the period of the
      Israelite monarchy, around the 7th to 4th centuries BCE.</p>

    <h1>History of Translation</h1>
    <p>The Book of Proverbs has been translated into numerous languages throughout history due to its universal themes
      and enduring wisdom. Some of the most notable translations include:</p>
